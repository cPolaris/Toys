**Toy**<br>

1. an object for a child to play with, typically a model or miniature replica of something: *[ as modifier ]* : a toy car.

- an object, especially a gadget or machine, regarded as providing amusement for an adult: in 1914 the car was still a rich man's toy.

~~- a person treated by another as a source of pleasure or amusement rather than with due seriousness: a man needed a friend, an ally, not an idol or a toy.~~
